# Future Plans & Features

## Downloadable Character System (YOMI-Style)

**Status**: Planned - Requires foundational systems first

**Overview**: 
Implement a mod loading system where users can download character packages (ZIP or folders) and drop them into a `mods/characters/` directory. The game will automatically discover and load these characters at runtime.

**Key Features**:
- Character packages with JSON manifests (stats, name, author, version)
- CharacterLoader singleton for discovery and loading
- Character selection UI
- Support for custom models/textures (optional)
- Mod management menu

**Prerequisites Before Implementation**:
- [ ] Stable character/hero system with multiple playable characters
- [ ] Character spawning system
- [ ] Character selection UI (even basic)
- [ ] Proper resource loading patterns
- [ ] Game state management
