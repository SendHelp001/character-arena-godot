Character Wars Arena

In this mode, players enter a dynamic arena where PvP meets PvE. The battlefield is a flexible space where enemy mobs spawn periodically, boss fights emerge, and multiple zones offer strategic depth. Players — alone or in teams — must survive, fight, and strive to meet a win condition: either defeat the final boss or achieve a kill‑score target.

The game supports customizable match modifiers (spawn rate, mob strength, boss-only, kill‑race, time‑limit, hybrid PvP+PvE) to allow varied experiences.

Under the hood, all characters (heroes, mobs, bosses) are defined via StatData resources, so stats, abilities, resistances, loot drops — everything can be edited or extended.
